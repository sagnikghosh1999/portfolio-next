 * This enum is used to represent the keys of the blogs in the database.
 * This enum is used to avoid hardcoding the keys in the code, getting autocompletion support and avoiding typos.
 * The strings correspond to location of the markdown files in the blog folder at `public/blog/`.
 * Whenever a new blog is added to the database, a new key should be added to this enum.
