# **Introduction**

Welcome to a summary of one of my personal project built during learning Full Stack Development. This report serves as a concise overview of the journey I embarked upon, the technological choices I made, and the process I followed in creating an interactive and efficient web application. The project reflects my accumulated learnings and is an illustration of my technical abilities put to the test.

# **Backend Development**

For a dynamic web application like Airbnb, backend development was critical in managing and manipulating data to enable the application's interactive features.

For database I used a no-sql database mongoDB and prisma a next-generation ORM that makes working with databases easy.

For Authentication I used Next-Auth where I included social login along with email-password combination.

For Image upload I used the cloudinary CDN.

# **Technology Stack**

In the development of this project, I employed a robust and modern technology stack that allowed me to construct a scalable, efficient, and interactive web application. The stack incorporated the use of TypeScript, Next.js, Zustand State Manager, mongoDB, and Prisma. Let's delve into these technologies, their roles, and why they were chosen.

**TypeScript:** TypeScript is a powerful JavaScript superset that brings static typing to the table. The addition of optional static typing is an immense aid in the development of large-scale JavaScript applications, as it allows for early error detection, fosters the creation of more maintainable code, and provides extensive editor support. Leveraging TypeScript proved critical in ensuring the code's reliability and ease of management.

**Next.js:** This popular React framework is an exceptional tool for building server-side rendered (SSR) and statically generated web applications. It presents a toolkit of conventions that simplifies the construction of contemporary, high-performance web applications, and its versatile nature enables easy deployment across various hosting environments. Utilizing Next.js allowed for a smooth development process, offering enhanced performance and SEO capabilities to the web application.

**MongoDB and Prisma:** Using MongoDB with Prisma offers a powerful combination for modern application development. MongoDB, a flexible NoSQL database, allows for scalable storage of diverse data types, making it ideal for handling unstructured and semi-structured data. Prisma, an advanced ORM, provides a type-safe and intuitive interface for interacting with databases, streamlining database operations and reducing boilerplate code. Together, they enable rapid development and efficient data management. Prisma’s schema-driven approach ensures data consistency and ease of migrations, while MongoDB’s horizontal scalability and high performance ensure the application can handle growing data loads and complex queries efficiently.

**Zustand State Manager:** Zustand is a potent state management library designed specifically for React applications. It offers a streamlined, flexible, and efficient way to manage shared state across an application. With its React-centric design, Zustand fits perfectly within complex or large-scale applications, providing a robust yet simple state management solution. Its application within this project facilitated the efficient handling and management of the app state.

Each of these technologies played a pivotal role in the successful development of the project, offering unique advantages that helped shape the final outcome. Together, they formed a formidable stack that supported the efficient realization of a high-quality, user-centric web application.

## **Future Considerations**

Currently this project doesn't take the latitude longitude of the address of the location while creating the listing. I am planning to use geoapify api for this.

# **Frontend Development**

The development of the frontend in this project involved a considerable amount of decision-making regarding the tools, libraries, and technologies that would be used. During the initial stage, a number of options were considered, including various state management libraries, UI libraries, and even different JavaScript frameworks. Ultimately, I settled on using Next.js, which provides a solid foundation for the development of a frontend application.

## **Next.js vs. Regular React**

The choice between using Next.js and regular React was driven by several considerations. React, while powerful and versatile, has some limitations that make it less suitable for large-scale projects such as this one. Firstly, React lacks a defined structure and allows developers to write code in their own style, potentially leading to a cluttered and hard-to-maintain codebase. Secondly, React requires additional libraries and tools for tasks such as routing, and server-side rendering, introducing a steep learning curve and additional complexity. Finally, React's lack of built-in SEO optimization can lead to issues with search engine crawling and indexing.

Next.js addresses these limitations, making it a more suitable choice for our needs. Built on top of React, Next.js is a framework that provides server-side rendering (SSR) and static website generation, alongside automatic code splitting and optimized performance. The support for static exporting in Next.js allows developers to generate static HTML files, which can be served directly from a Content Delivery Network (CDN), resulting in faster page load times and improved performance.

By using Next.js, we ensured a set standard for code consistency, allowing for more straightforward collaboration between developers. It also eliminated the need for cumbersome configurations and the addition of missing functionalities that were required with regular React.
