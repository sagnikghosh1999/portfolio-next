I build scalable, high-performance web applications using **React**, **Next.js**, **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Prisma**.
With 4+ years of experience delivering production-ready systems across the stack, I specialize in crafting **clean architectures**, **efficient APIs**, and **fast, accessible user interfaces**.

I’ve engineered automation platforms that cut operational effort by **70%**, optimized apps for **Core Web Vitals**, and shipped features in fast-paced, product-driven environments.
Passionate about **performance, testing, automation, and developer experience**, I love turning ideas into reliable, user-focused products.
